# Exercise 0 > Initial State

Before we begin coding, we want to verify that the initial state is working as
expected. From your `sbt` session: 

Use the `test` command to verify the initial state works as expected.
You should see something like the following:

```scala
...
[info] Run completed in 50 milliseconds.
[info] Total number of tests run: 0
[info] Suites: completed 0, aborted 0
[info] Tests: succeeded 0, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0
[info] No tests were executed.
[success] Total time: 1 s, ...
```

Use the `nextExercise` command to move to the next exercise.
